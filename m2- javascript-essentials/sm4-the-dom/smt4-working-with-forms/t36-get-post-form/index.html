<!-- Form Get and Post -->
<!-- In this example, we have two forms. The first form is submitted via POST, and the second form is submitted via GET. -->
<!-- The first form is submitted via POST. You cannot see any of the form data. -->
<!-- The second form is submitted via GET. Look at the URL and you will see everything you submitted there in plaintext (albeit it is URL-encoded). -->

An important distinction when working with forms is whether the data is submitted via a GET or a POST request. This isn't just relevant to JavaScript 
either - it's actually part of the HTTP request/response cycle itself. The key difference is that a GET request submits the form data through the URL 
as URL parameters while a POST request submits it in the data component of the HTTP request itself. In practicality, this means that form data submitted 
via a GET request will always be visible to the user in their URL while POST data will remain hidden. This is an important distinction to make, especially 
when it comes to working with sensitive form data.

The determination of whether to use GET or POST when submitting a form is made using the method attribute of the form element in the HTML. A form with 
method="POST" will keep the data hidden while a form using method="GET" will encode it as URL parameters and submit it via the URL. For forms that don't 
submit anything at all (for example those that have their default action prevented and are only used as a means of modifying the DOM), the method attribute 
can be left off completely, but it's important to know that if you don't specify it, it will default to GET which could expose sensitive data if you forget 
to use event.preventDefault().

To illustrate, here is a form submitted with the POST method:
-->
<form method="POST" action="/login/">
    ...
</form>

<!-- And here is a form submitted with the GET method: -->
<form method="GET" action="/search/">
    ...
</form>

<!-- In general you should prefer to submit form data using POST, but using GET is sometimes required (for example in order to generate sharable URLs which 
    have captured form data, e.g. https://www.example.com/search?query=thing). In this example, the user could copy the entire URL, including their search for 
    "thing" and send it to a friend. Using POST would not allow this because the query would be hidden in the POST request. The opposite requirement would be a 
    login form: you would not want a username or password to be submitted as URL parameters which could show up in the browser history or be shared publicly.
