# Arrays and Lists

# Arrays and Lists are both used to store data in Python. They can be used to store any type of data, such as numbers, strings, and even other lists. However, there are some differences between the two.

flowers = ['daisy', 'bluebell', 'buttercup', 'rose', 'tulip', 'daffodil', 'orchid', 'geranium', 'heather', 'hydrangea']
flower = flowers[9] # hydrangea is at index 9
print(flowers) # prints the entire list 
print(flower) # prints hydrangea

# Arrays
# An array is a collection of elements of the same type. It is a fixed-size container that can hold a specific number of items. The elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations. The array elements can be accessed using an index. Arrays can be of two types: one-dimensional and multi-dimensional. For example, the following code creates a one-dimensional array of integers with five elements:

# Lists
# A list is the Python equivalent of an array, but is resizeable and can contain elements of different types. You can add and remove elements from a list, and you can also find the length of a list. You can use the list() constructor to create a list in Python. For example, the following code creates a list of integers:


# The main difference between arrays and lists is the functions that you can perform on them. For example, you can divide an array by 3, but you cannot divide a list by 3. You can also use the len() function to find the length of an array, but you cannot use it to find the length of a list. In general, arrays are more efficient than lists. However, lists are more flexible than arrays. You can use lists for any purpose, but arrays are best suited for storing a fixed number of elements of the same type.
