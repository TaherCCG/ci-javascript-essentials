// Quotations
// In JavaScript, you can use either single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`) to create a string. This is useful if you want to include a quotation mark or apostrophe in your string.
// For example:  

// Define the variables below:
let stringWithQuotes = 'Confucius once said, "It does not matter how slowly you go, as long as you do not stop."';
let stringWithApostrophe = "Everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of fear.";

// These lines will log your quotes to the console:
console.log(stringWithQuotes);
console.log(stringWithApostrophe);
