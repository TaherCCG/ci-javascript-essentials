// While loops
/* While loops are used to execute a block of code as long as the specified condition is true. 
The condition is evaluated before executing the code.
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
The while loop will continue to loop as long as the condition is true.
It's important to remember to increment the variable, otherwise the loop will continue to 
execute indefinitely. */
